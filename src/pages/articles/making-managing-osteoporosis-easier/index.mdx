Most companies try to stay ahead of the curve when it comes to visual design, but for Planetaria we needed to create a brand that would still inspire us 100 years from now when humanity has spread across our entire solar system.

I knew that to get it right I was going to have to replicate the viewing conditions of someone from the future, so I grabbed my space helmet from the closet, created a new Figma document, and got to work.

## Sermone fata

Lorem markdownum, bracchia in redibam! Terque unda puppi nec, linguae posterior
in utraque respicere candidus Mimasque formae; quae conantem cervice. Parcite
variatus, redolentia adeunt. Tyrioque dies, naufraga sua adit partibus celanda
torquere temptata, erit maneat et ramos, [iam](#) ait dominari
potitus! Tibi litora matremque fumantia condi radicibus opusque.
